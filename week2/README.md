# Week 2 - Array, Loops, and Object Literals

## Code Exercies

As part of the web frameworks course, students are required to submit exercises weekly that strengthen their understanding of OOP concepts using javascript and/or typescript.

Submissions should be made by forking this repo into each students' github account.

## Requirements and Caveats

Use the following guidlines as reminders for your submissions.

- Use ES6 as the primary javascript target.
- All scripts should be linted before submission.
- When specified, `.ts` files should be compiled to `.js`.

DAVID EDIT:
to run each file, go into week2 in terminal and Run:

node arrays-and-loops.js
node object-literal.js

P.S. I am still a bit confused about linting so I tried my best to do what you asked, could we go over this on Thursday?
